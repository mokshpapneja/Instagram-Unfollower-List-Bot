# Instagram-Unfollower-List-Bot
This is a program that when run on pycharm,vscode with selenium imported would give out the accounts that you are following but aren't following you.

Requirements:-

1.Laptop/PC

2.IDE to run Python 3.9.7 (Preferably Pycharm)

3.Selenium Installed (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-selenium-in-python/)  
//This can be done browser specific,but preferably chrome webdriver

4.Instagram account

Once all these things are set-up, just download the .py file and runit on selenium and it would give you the output on you IDE's console.

About the Bot:-
The bot essentially scrolls thorugh your follower and following and puts them in seperate lists.Then, it compares these lists to find out which accounts you follow don't follow you back. You can use both the instagram and facebook login features.

IMPORTANT: Note that you should be careful about your exact usernames and passwords as the program gives an error when wrong account credentials are entered.
